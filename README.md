# Personal Blog

Welcome to the home of my writing on engineering, design, and the human side of building software. This site is a deliberately minimalist reading experience—no pop-ups, no distractions—just thoughtful articles presented with plenty of breathing room.

## What you'll find
- **Deep-dive essays** that document the lessons I learn while shipping real products.
- **Short riffs** on ideas that are still forming—half-baked thoughts I may revisit later.
- **Curated links** highlighting tools, talks, and books that have shaped how I work.

Each post includes context, publication dates, and related reading so you can trace a topic as it evolves over time.

## Reading experience
- **Typography built for longform**: generous line height, responsive spacing, and dark-mode friendly colors.
- **Fast navigation**: server-rendered routes mean the homepage and post pages are ready almost instantly.
- **Accessible by design**: semantic HTML, focus states, and keyboard-friendly navigation make the site usable for everyone.

## Design principles
1. **Clarity over flash** – visual flourishes only appear when they support the story.
2. **Consistency** – shared layouts keep you oriented from the archive to individual posts.
3. **Focus on the words** – the content drives the layout, not the other way around.

## Behind the scenes
- Built with the latest Next.js App Router and React Server Components for speed.
- Prisma and SQLite power the content layer, keeping drafts and published posts in sync.
- Tailwind CSS handles styling with a lean, utility-first approach.

## Writing workflow
1. Draft in my notes app of choice.
2. Polish copy, imagery, and metadata directly in Prisma Studio.
3. Publish with a single commit—no complex build steps required.

## Thanks for reading
I’m always exploring new ideas, tools, and ways of working. If an article resonates, feel free to reach out or share it with someone who might enjoy the read.
